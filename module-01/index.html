    <p>This is the beginning of my long and wonderful journey into JavaScript programming and mapping.</p>
<h2>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h2>
    <p>
        
        The Floating Sheep Manifesto offered many great examples of the power of maps to present bias and accuracy at the same time. But also the real world reprucussions that can result when decisions are made based on maps that may not be presented fairly or created for ethical reasons.</p>
        
        <p>A lot of people who come into contact with maps seem to treat them as an object that they want to, or believe they should be able to, make sense of immediately. This trait gives the map a lot of power of influence when the map reader is pre disposed to hasty analysis. They aren't conditioned to see maps as a story with competing elements, that bodies of content within the map may represent different motives.</p> 
        
        <p>Reading the manifesto I contemplated some of the maps I make in my own work and came up with ideas like the aforementioned. I enjoyed it. </p>
        
        <p>I see myself as a combination of coder and cartographer at the moment. Less of a critic. Since I spend so much time around maps I've already realized the importance of cartographic design to creating appealing and effective maps, so I've spent time researching on my own and gathering practical guide books. Neo-geography, while a term I heard for a long time but had no idea what it meant, is something I've embraced, in that I have learned to code and now wish to add a coding vocabulary of web-mapping to my skill set.</p>
        
        <p>I highly value the creative and artistic aspect of mapping and hope to learn skills to create maps that truly force the map user to take a look and immediately realize that they are looking at a map worthy of study, and that they may need to engage their imagination to get at the truth of what its saying. Learning to map practically and display scientific/business information is of course also a goal of mine!
